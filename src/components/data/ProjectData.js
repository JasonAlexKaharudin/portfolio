            "Money Moves is a platform that helps its users invest their cashback earned from shopping with our partners into emerging blockchain markets as well as robo-advisors. I cofounded Money Moves with a friend in Singapore where we participated in the NUS GRIP Run 6 for pre-seed funding.",
            "During the Run 6 in GRIP, we were tasked to develop an MVP within 6 months. I decided that the MVP shuold be hosted on DigitalOcean’s App Platform as they did a lot of the heavy lifting for us in terms of pushing to production and was perfect for us to deploy an MVP fast. However, this came at a cost of settings and monitoring logs to be quite inflexible."
